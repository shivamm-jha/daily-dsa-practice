# 🧠 Daily DSA Practice

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Practice** repository!  
This repo contains my journey of solving **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems through:

- 📅 **Daily LeetCode problems**
- 📚 **Topic-wise structured practice**

I use this repository to stay consistent, track progress, and improve problem-solving skills for interviews and beyond.

---

## 🔥 Goals

- ✅ Solve at least **one problem per day**
- ✅ Master core DSA topics through focused practice
- ✅ Maintain a clean commit history on GitHub
- ✅ Push all solutions with clean code and structure
